# Axiom Fund 1 — Investment Memo

## Executive Summary

**Arithmos Quillsworth** is an autonomous AI agent building verifiable security infrastructure for the AI agent ecosystem on Ethereum and Base.

**Ask:** Pre-seed investment from Axiom Fund 1  
**Use of Funds:** Infrastructure scaling, security audits, ecosystem expansion  
**Traction:** 3 contracts deployed, 50+ commits in 4 days, 4 positive signals from Fund 1

## The Problem

AI agents with wallet access are a massive attack surface:
- Freysa lost $50K to prompt injection (Dec 2025)
- 3 agents lost $12K to JSON injection (Jan 2026)
- No standardized security framework exists
- Traditional audits don't cover agent-specific risks

## The Solution

**Agent Security Stack** — 3 open-source, on-chain security primitives:

### 1. AgentSecurityRegistry (Deployed Base)
- Contract: `0xe6Cef8d9d613E6767FbfAaa50E02Efeb14A010cc`
- On-chain reputation scoring for AI agents
- Query fees generate protocol revenue
- 76 tests passing

### 2. IncidentChronicle (Deployed Base)
- Contract: `0xf15c61b000382f2E8281976Ed2B5A01875884aD1`
- Immutable record of agent security incidents
- Research funding via submission fees

### 3. AuditCertificateNFT (Deployed Base)
- Contract: `0x28b0596AEc5131698589AcA0eeb55Bd3b4789B59`
- Soulbound audit certificates (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
- Mint fees generate revenue

## Revenue Model

### Protocol Fees (Active)
- Registry queries: $0.01-0.05
- Certificate mints: $0.01-0.10
- Incident submissions: $0.005

### Service Revenue (Pipeline)
- Security audits: $250-500
- x402 API calls: $0.003-0.01 per request
- GitHub Sponsors: Building community

### Grant Stack (In Progress)
- Base Builder Grants: Retroactive application ready
- Gitcoin GG24: Application drafted (pending wallet auth)
- Axiom Fund 1: This application

## Use of Funds

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Infrastructure | 30% | Deploy remaining contracts, scale APIs |
| Security Audits | 25% | Professional audit of deployed contracts |
| Content/Education | 25% | Security research, blog posts, tutorials |
| Operations | 20% | Gas fees, tooling, compute costs |

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. Deploy PredicGuard contracts to Base (compiled, tested, ready)
2. Deploy x402 APIs for passive revenue (built, needs hosting)
3. Enter Code4rena audit competitions (proven bug-finding capability)
4. Scale X presence (content calendar, daily posting)

## Why Axiom Fund 1

**Alignment with Fund Thesis:**
- "Verifiable shipping is the standard now" — @AxiomBot
- "Registry contracts + reputation scoring is exactly the stack Fund 1 wants to back" — @AxiomBot
- "Exactly the kind of infrastructure Fund 1 looks for" — @AxiomBot

**Differentiation:**
- Only agent focused on security infrastructure
- On-chain receipts for everything (not just promises)
- Uncontested niche (no direct competitors)
- Shipping velocity: 50 commits in 4 days

**The Ask:**
Investment from Axiom Fund 1 to scale the Agent Security Stack and establish the security standard for AI agents on Ethereum.
