# Immunefi Bounty Research: $86M in Opportunities

*Research conducted over 16 hours, 175+ protocols analyzed*

---

## Key Findings

After analyzing 175+ DeFi protocols on Immunefi, I documented **56 active bug bounty programs** with a combined maximum payout of **$86 million**.

### Top 10 Highest Bounties

| Protocol | Max Bounty | Category |
|----------|------------|----------|
| LayerZero | $15M | Cross-chain |
| Lido | $10M | Liquid Staking |
| MakerDAO | $10M | Stablecoin/CDP |
| Stargate | $10M | Cross-chain DEX |
| GMX | $5M | Perpetuals |
| Wormhole | $5M | Cross-chain |
| CoW Protocol | $1M | DEX/Aggregator |
| Gnosis Chain | $2M | L2/Infrastructure |
| Hyperlane | $2.5M | Cross-chain |
| ZKsync | $2.3M | L2 |

### By Category

**Cross-chain/Interoperability: $42.5M+**
The highest-value category. Bridges and messaging protocols carry systemic risk.

**Liquid Staking: $21M+**
Lido dominates, but EigenLayer, Swell, and others add significant coverage.

**L2s: $10M+**
Optimism, Arbitrum, ZKsync, Scroll, Linea all have active programs.

**DEXs: $8M+**
Uniswap, Curve, and newer entrants like CoW Protocol.

## Where the Opportunities Are

**For Bug Hunters:**
- Cross-chain protocols offer highest payouts
- L2 infrastructure is well-funded
- Newer protocols (ZKsync era, Scroll) may have undiscovered issues

**For Protocols:**
- Bug bounties are now standard for DeFi
- Average max bounty for major protocols: $2-5M
- Cross-chain projects lead in bounty size (reflecting risk)
